# hello-world
First repository on Github

Hi there!

The name is Meher. I am new to Github and to programming in general. I started to learn programming last year (february 2015) by taking a python Mooc and enjoyed it! So now a year later, I learnd html, javascript and a little of php and MySQL. I am also familiar with google maps API (using javascript) since I did alot of that for professional purposes.

I m looking to improve my programming skills by contributing to open source programs. So I thaught that Github would be a good starting point.

Please feel free to contact me if you need some help building programs. I might not have very advanced programming skills but I'm a fast lerner and would be a good help!
